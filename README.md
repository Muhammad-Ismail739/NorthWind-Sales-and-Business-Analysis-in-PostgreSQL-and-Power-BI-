# NorthWind Sales and Business Analysis – PostgresSQL & Power BI
This project analyzes sales performance by utilizing both SQL analysis and an interactive Power BI dashboard. The objective is to determine customer behavior, the profitability of products, and how well products perform based on regions while uncovering functional practice patterns such as shipping, product pairings, etc. With the SQL queries and Power BI visualizations combined, there is a full understanding of how the organization earns revenue, where it is successful, and where opportunities for change exist. 
# Project Goals:
1: Utilize SQL queries to analyze sales data and draw value from analytical insights.

2: Utilize Power BI to develop a dashboard that displays the historical performance of revenue, customer spend, product performance, and a snapshot of geographical patterns.

3: Evaluate top-performing products and customers, together with a master view of categories, suppliers, and employees.

4: Utilize Market Basket Analysis to evaluate order behavior.

5: Identify operational issues, including shipping times, high SKU dependency, and supplier concentration.

# Dataset:
The dataset includes several relational tables typically found in a retail/wholesale sales system. Key tables include:

1: Customers 

2: Orders & Order_Details 

3: Products 

4: Categories 

5: Employees

6: Suppliers 

6: Regions & Territories 

7: Customer Demographics 

# Project Contents: 
This project is divided into two main components, each providing a different lens on the sales dataset and together delivering a full, end-to-end analysis.

# SQL Analysis Report:

The SQL report contains 17+ analytical queries covering key business dimensions such as:

1: Revenue and profit breakdowns.

2: Customer spending behavior.

4: Product-level and category-level performance.

5: Country and region insights.

6: Employee sales contribution.

7: Logistics, freight, and shipping patterns.

4: Market basket analysis.

# Power BI Dashboard:

The Power BI file translates raw SQL insights into interactive visual analytics, including:

1: Monthly revenue fluctuations.

2: Product profitability comparison.

3: Average order value trends.

4: Count of unique customers.

5: Global revenue distribution map.

6: Top customers and top-performing employees.

7: Supplier revenue contribution.

8: Best selling products.

9: Product association patterns (Market basket analysis).

# Key Takeaways:

1: A small number of customers, products, and employees depends on a high concentration of revenue and profit.

2: Average Order Value is consistently high, indicating strong purchasing behavior from customers.

3: There are several high-margin products (e.g. Côte de Blaye) that generate exceptionally high profit.

4: The USA and several major countries in Europe account for the world revenue.

5: There are strong natural pairing products (Market Basket Analysis) that could represent bundling opportunities.

6: There are several critical dependencies in SKUs and suppliers that require risk planning.

7: Shipping times appear elevated and should be reviewed operationally.

# Summary:
This project fuses in-depth SQL analysis with visual storytelling in Power BI to better examine how a business really operates. It identifies the potential for strong growth and high-value orders, but also highlights certain concentration risks and operational inefficiencies that should be acted upon. It not only brings together actionable insights from the query-level analysis but does so in a way that is simple to interpret, easily visualized in dashboards, and meaningful to both technical and non-technical individuals alike.
